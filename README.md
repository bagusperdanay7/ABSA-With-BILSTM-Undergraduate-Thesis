# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Towards Market Place Application Review Using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory

[**Dokumentasi Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesia Documentation)**](/docs/id/README.md)

My undergraduate thesis, **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Towards Market Place Application Reviews Using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory**, uses the **Python** programming language and the **Keras** and **Tensorflow** libraries to create AI models using 3000 review datasets of one Indonesian marketplace that were collected from _Google Play Store_ platform. This undergraduate thesis was supervised by Mrs. Nelly Indriani Widiastuti, S.Si., M.T.
