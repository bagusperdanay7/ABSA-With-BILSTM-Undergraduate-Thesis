# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Towards Market Place Application Review Using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory

[**Dokumentasi Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesia Documentation)**](/docs/id/README.md)

My undergraduate thesis, **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis Towards Market Place Application Reviews Using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory**, uses the `Python` programming language and the `Keras` and `Tensorflow` libraries to create AI models using 3000 review datasets of one Indonesian marketplace that were collected from Google Play Store platform. This undergraduate thesis was supervised by Mrs. Nelly Indriani Widiastuti, M.T.
